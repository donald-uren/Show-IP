Show IP

Shows the IPv4 address of the Raspberry PI on the sense hat LED board.
Original code supplied by RMIT.

This code has been modified to clear the screen on keyboard interrupts and to allow use of joystick to exit program after displaying its message so the user does not need to connect to the PI to stop the program.
